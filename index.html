        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Hello, I'm Rob. my hometown is Greymouth</p>
        <p>Growing up on the coast in New Zealand has given me a lifelong passion for the ocean, and deep respect for nature.</p>
        <p>After leaving home I spent years trying different careers and lifestyles, nothing really stuck.</p>
        <p>eventually, I bought my own house in a little town on the coast.</p>
        <p>My second love has always been computers in my free time and evenings. Mostly I played online games with my friends, but as my life has evolved I feel now is the right time to turn my hobby into a career.
          So here I am starting a tech degree in front-end web development and so far I am really enjoying it.</p>
